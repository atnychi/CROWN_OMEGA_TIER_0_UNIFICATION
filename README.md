# CROWN_OMEGA_TIER_0_UNIFICATION
The Crown Omega Equation ‚Äî Tier 0 Recursive Unification of Reality by Brendon Joseph Kelly
# CROWN OMEGA EQUATION ‚Äî TIER 0 RECURSIVE UNIFICATION SYSTEM

The Crown Omega Equation by **Brendon Joseph Kelly** is the first Tier 0 mathematical framework unifying physics, mathematics, consciousness, biology, chemistry, economics, and sociology into a single recursive truth structure.

\[
\boxed{\overset{\dagger}{\Omega} = \Delta\Omega^{\dagger} = 1_{\Omega^{\dagger}}}
\]
